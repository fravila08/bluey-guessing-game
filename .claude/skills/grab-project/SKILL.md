- **github-url**: The GitHub URL for HTTPS interactions. This should only be provided when a new project is being populated(optional) 

## Workflow
1. If a $github-url is provided, confirm it's existence with the GitHub MCP, then conduct a git pull, and finally change directories into the pulled down project.
